I'm a second-year Phd Student in the Scool of Computer Science at Peking University, advised by Associate Professor (with tenure) Guojie Luo. Currently, my research interest is at computer architecture, electronic design automation, and heterogeneous computing. I'm exploring how to enhance domain-specific system performance and efficiency with both the compilation technique and architecutre design. I'm also interested in the electronic design automation techniques, especially logic optimization.

I obtained my bachelor degree in computer science in 2022 from the school of EECS in Peking University. I have been a research intern at PKU-DASYS Group (Design Automation for Next-generation Computing Systems) with Professor Guojie Luo since 2020. During the intership and Phd pursuing, I focus on logic optimization and high level synthesis to build FPGA accelerators. I have also worked as teaching assistant in the course Introduction to Parallel and Distributed Computing and accumulated valuable experiences in teaching.
